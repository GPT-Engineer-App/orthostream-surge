Landing Page Overview and Aesthetic
Theme: The page will have a dark theme, providing a sleek and modern look that is easy on the eyes, especially in medical settings where users may prefer lower brightness.
Background: A minimalistic image related to orthopedics, such as a subtle silhouette of bones or skeletal structure, serves as the background. This not only reinforces the medical theme but also maintains a clean and unobtrusive design.
Key Features of the Landing Page
Countdown Timer

Purpose: A prominent feature on the landing page is a countdown timer that ticks down to the release date of the demo, set to launch in 30 days from the viewer's current date.
Design: The timer is displayed in a bold, clear font with distinct segments for days, hours, minutes, and seconds. This timer should be easily visible against the page's dark background and adds an element of urgency and anticipation.
Header and Footer

Header: Contains the logo and the name "OrthoStream" along with a welcoming tagline such as "Welcome to the future of orthopedic scheduling!" This sets a professional tone and introduces the product.
Footer: Includes copyright information and reinforces the brand identity. It maintains a simple aesthetic that doesn't distract from the main content of the page.
Responsive Design

The page must be responsive, ensuring it looks good on devices of all sizes, from desktops to smartphones. This is crucial for accessibility and user experience.
CSS Styling

Colors: Uses shades of dark greys and whites for text to ensure readability and focus on content.
Fonts: Modern sans-serif fonts that are web-friendly and enhance readability.
Buttons and Links: Styled to stand out with a contrasting color, possibly in a lighter or theme-accent color, ensuring they are easy to locate and click.
Technical Considerations
SEO Optimized: Ensure that all content is SEO-friendly to maximize visibility.
Speed and Performance: Optimize images and assets for fast loading times, crucial for maintaining user engagement and satisfaction.
Accessibility Standards: Adhere to web accessibility standards to ensure the site is usable by people with various disabilities.
Implementation Notes
The countdown functionality should be tested to ensure accuracy and reliability, updating in real-time.
The background image should be optimized for web use, ensuring it loads quickly without sacrificing quality.
